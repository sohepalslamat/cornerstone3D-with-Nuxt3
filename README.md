# cornerstone3D-with-Nuxt3

**Overview:**
This repository showcases an integration of Cornerstone3D, a powerful 3D visualization library for medical imaging, with Nuxt.js 3, a modern framework for building Vue.js applications. The project aims to provide a structured and efficient way to render DICOM images and interact with 3D medical visualizations using the latest technologies.

**Key Features:**

- **3D Visualization**: Harness the capabilities of Cornerstone3D to display and manipulate 3D medical images.
- **Nuxt 3 Framework**: Built with Nuxt 3, allowing for server-side rendering, API routes, and easy deployment.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily expand functionality through a modular design, making it simpler to maintain and enhance.
- **Example DICOM Viewer**: Includes a basic DICOM viewer as an example of the capabilities of Cornerstone3D.

**Technologies Used:**

- Vue.js 3
- Nuxt.js 3
- Cornerstone3D
